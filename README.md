#### From 2012 to 2019, Netflix's revenue increased from $3.6 billion to $20.2 billion, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32.5%. However, in 2020, the company experienced a slowdown in revenue growth       due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with only a 24%      increase in revenue over the previous year. In 2022,             an income of 31,616 million dollars was reported,          6.07% more than in 2021.   

#### Looking at the data more closely, we can see that Netflix's revenue growth was primarily driven by its international expansion, with international revenues increasing from $1.2 billion in 2012 to $9.6 billion in 2019, a CAGR of 38 .6%. This compares to a CAGR of 26.9% for national revenue during the same period.

#### Overall, the data indicates that Netflix has experienced significant revenue growth over the past 10 years, driven in large part by its international expansion. However, the company's revenue growth slowed in 2022 due to various factors globally, including the emergence of platforms such as Disney, Paramount, AmazonPrima, among others. The company's main source of revenue is based on subscriptions, which is consistent with its business model as a streaming service provider.

#### Based on this analysis, it would be advisable for Netflix to continue its international expansion efforts while exploring ways to diversify its revenue streams to mitigate the impact of any future disruption to the streaming market.
